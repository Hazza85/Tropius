This repo contains any scripts and assets created during the the Tropius project

The project was forked from the WebXR AR Starter Kit provided by PlayCanvas itself. This kit can be found at https://playcanvas.com/project/984974/overview/webxr-ar-starter-kit (accessed 30.04.25).
Some of the assets and scripts used in this project were provided as part of this kit, other code that was adapted from other sources such as the PlayCanvas tutorials will have a comment in that script declaring so.
